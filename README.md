# Ava - Turn Any Android Device into a Smart Home Control Panel

For more practical guides, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/knoop7/Ava/wiki). Images and detailed explanations will be added gradually.

Share a project I've been working on: **Ava**, an Android voice assistant app that turns old tablets and phones into powerful smart home control panels.

## Background

This project is based on [brownard/Ava](https://github.com/brownard/Ava) with extensive modifications and extensions. The original was a great ESPHome voice satellite implementation, but with basic features. I researched existing solutions: [Fully Kiosk](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/) is powerful but paid. [WallPanel](https://wallpanel.xyz/) is no longer maintained. The Android smart home panel space has been stagnant for years. So I decided to combine the best of these projects, using Ava as the foundation to build something truly useful.

## Core Philosophy

**No Extra Integrations**
No MQTT, no HACS. Devices are discovered natively by Home Assistant, just like ESPHome nodes.

**Built for Low-End Hardware**
Supports Android 7–16, including 32-bit devices. Cheap tablets and old phones work reliably.

**Expanding to Android 4.4–6**
Earlier Android versions are currently under active development. The goal is full BLE proxy compatibility without compromises

---

## Bluetooth Proxy - Exclusive Feature

**This is a feature no other Android panel app has.**

Your Android device becomes a complete Bluetooth gateway, extending Home Assistant's Bluetooth coverage. No ESP32 needed - just use your spare Android device!

**Features:** **BLE Proxy** - Forwards all Bluetooth Low Energy data to Home Assistant. **Whole-Home Coverage** - Deploy multiple Ava devices, each extends Bluetooth range. **Presence Detection** - Auto-detect phones, smartwatches, bands; trigger home/away automations. **All BLE Devices Compatible** - Temperature sensors, plant monitors, smart locks, all supported.

**Why This Matters:** ESP32 Bluetooth proxies need firmware flashing and configuration. Ava works out of the box - your Android device is already a powerful Bluetooth transceiver. Perfect for apartments or multi-story homes where one Bluetooth source isn't enough. Turn that dusty old tablet in the bedroom into a Bluetooth relay point.

**Presence Detection Use Cases:** Phone enters Bluetooth range → Auto lights on, AC on, play welcome message. Phone leaves for a while → Auto lights off, security mode on. Detect specific family member devices → Personalized scene triggers. Adjustable RSSI threshold and away delay for precise sensitivity control.

This feature alone is worth trying if you've struggled with Bluetooth coverage in Home Assistant.

> **Note:** Bluetooth proxy source code is not open source, only available in release builds. All other feature code is available on GitHub.

## Floating Windows - Visual Differentiation

This is what makes Ava visually unique. **Floating windows overlay on top of any app** - display a full-screen HA dashboard while still seeing clock, weather, and notifications overlaid on top.

Other apps force you to choose: dashboard or clock. With Ava, you get both.

- **Always Visible** - Overlays on any app, including full-screen browsers. **HA Control** - Remotely toggle each window from Home Assistant. **Non-Intrusive** - Designed to complement, not block the main interface.

Available floating windows: Dream Clock - Elegant always-on clock. Vinyl Cover - Rotating record cover when playing music. Conversation Subtitles - Shows what you said and AI responses. Notification Scenes - Full-screen alerts for doorbell, alarms, etc.

## What is Ava?

Ava is a voice assistant app based on the ESPHome protocol. It turns your Android device into a voice satellite for Home Assistant.

**What can you do with it?** Control smart home devices with voice (lights, AC, music, etc.). Display beautiful screensavers and clocks. Show real-time weather information. Display full-screen notifications (doorbell, alerts, etc.). Play music with album cover display. Take photos and stream video.

Put your old phone or tablet at home, and it becomes a smart control panel!

**System Requirements:** Android 7.0 or higher. Home Assistant connection required.

> This makes Ava suitable for turning *any* phone or tablet into a native-looking Home Assistant panel, consistent with the rest of your HA ecosystem.




> Ava does not impose a custom UI identity.
> Instead, it deliberately follows Home Assistant’s visual language and iconography.
> This ensures that any device running Ava feels like an extension of Home Assistant itself, not a third-party layer on top.

## FAQ

### Ava can't hear me

**Check these:** 1. Is microphone permission granted? Go to phone Settings → Apps → Ava → Permissions → Microphone → Allow. 2. Is wake word set correctly? Settings → Voice Satellite → Wake Words. 3. Is the device muted? Check volume buttons.

### Can't connect to Home Assistant

**Check these:** 1. Are device and Home Assistant on the same WiFi? 2. Is Home Assistant address correct? 3. Is ESPHome integration enabled in Home Assistant?

### Screensaver not showing

**Check these:** 1. Is screensaver enabled? Settings → Screensaver → Enable. 2. Is overlay permission granted? Go to phone Settings → Apps → Ava → Permissions → Overlay → Allow. 3. Is timeout set? Settings → Screensaver → Timeout.

## Tips

### 1. Choose a Good Wake Word

Choose a word that's easy to say but you don't often say in normal conversation. This way Ava won't trigger by accident.

### 2. Protect the Screen

If the device screen is on for long periods: Lower screen brightness. Use screensaver (screensaver moves content to prevent burn-in).

### 3. Keep Network Stable

Good WiFi signal means better voice recognition accuracy.

### 4. Update Regularly

Check for app updates. New versions have more features and fixes. Ava has built-in auto-update.

### Signing Release APK
1. Create keystore: `keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-alias`
2. Create `keystore.properties` in project root:
```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=my-alias
