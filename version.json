  "changelog": "New: inject Greasemonkey-style user scripts (some may need a quick Gemini polish at https://gemini.google.com/gem/e087b34309a4). Added: custom browser UA string; root-free activity starter. Fixed: browser tab-switch clashes gone, Bluetooth power naps tamed, stodgy labels cleaned, wake-word reliability up, voice race-conditions quiet. Smoother surfing, steadier talking."
