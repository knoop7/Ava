  "changelog": "**mwon** StemDock floating dashboard—pin up to 6 HA devices in a smart auto-grid\nthat flips between portrait and landscape. Tap to toggle, long-press to reorder,\nhide by long-pressing empty space. Colors auto-pick from 22 soft tones (lights\nalways warm yellow), icons map by entity type, names and units sync live from\nHome Assistant. Enable via Display ▸ Quick Entity Panel; fill slots in-app or\nturn on “HA Slot Configuration” and edit the six text inputs\n(ava_quick_entity_slot_1-6) straight from Lovelace—clear all and the panel\nvanishes, fill any one and it reappears. Sensors update to two decimals, covers\nget position sliders, fans show speed, buttons run scripts instantly. Under the\nhood we unified every toggle style, fixed dark-mode background glitches, squashed\nmuted-device wake-word crashes, tamed nav-bar hide logic on Android ≤11, trimmed\nclock FPS to 15 for cooler batteries, plugged memory leaks, recalibrated\nscreensaver triggers, restored swipe-unlock, ended audio-stream fights, quieted\nproximity loops, added Vietnamese translations and let notification previews\nplay on legacy OS. 21 fixes, one cooler, cleaner, faster wall tablet."
