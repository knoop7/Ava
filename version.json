  "changelog": "HOTFIX: critical crash resolved, app now runs normally. Overlay permission check added—static methods verify canDrawOverlays before service start. Fixed floating window flash on init. WakeWordArbiter port binding fixed with reuseAddress. ClientConnection resources close cleanly. Floating status labels rebuilt inside EsperSphereView, auto-follow sphere. Text cards hug bottom, max 20% height, nav-bar aware. Removed card header status, wave icons, redundant BLE logs. General optimizations throughout. Thanks @ohjables, @zaiahgaming."
