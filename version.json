  "changelog": "HA media player recovery—pause+play restores external audio after TTS. Smooth volume duck/unDuck with gradient animation. TTS race fixed: runStart triggers old callback first, removed redundant player.init(). Floating subtitles use lazy bringToFront for better layering. Reply text gets shadow layer for readability. ESPHome bumped to 2026.2.1. TTS delay optimized—init() moved to play(). BLE watchdog auto-detects scan failures on low-end 4.0 chips and recovers dynamically by power mode."
